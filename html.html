<h2>My name is Ella Yasar</h2>
<p class="writing"> I'm a freshman at Piedmont High School in Mrs. Newell's computing class. I've been running XC and track since 4th grade, love to read, enjoy traveling (especially to tropical places), and adore my two dogs Harpo and Birdie! I was born in South Carolina and have lived all over the country and state, but finally settled in Piedmont, California when I was six years old. I am intrested in pursuing a career in psychology, specifically criminology, because I love understanding the why behind peoples behavior and want to help others. Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me!</p>
